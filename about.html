                <p>A club is an association of people united by a common interest or goal. A service club, for
                    example,exists for voluntary or charitable activities. There are clubs devoted to hobbies and
                    sports, socialactivities clubs, political and religious clubs, and so forth, The word “club,” in the
                    sense of an association to promote good-fellowship and social intercourse, became common in England
                    at the time of Tatler and The Spectator (1709–1712). With the introduction of coffee-drinking in the
                    middle of the 17th century, clubs entered on a more permanent phase. The coffee houses of the later
                    Stuart period are the real originals of the modern clubhouse.
